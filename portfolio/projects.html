    <h1>Face Mask detector:</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      We Introduce a face mask detection model that is based on Artificial Intelligence. The proposed model can be integrated with surveillance cameras to impede the COVID-19 transmission by allowing the detection of people who are wearing masks not wearing face masks. The model is integration between deep learning and classical machine learning techniques with opencv, tensor flow and keras.

    <h2> Aim of the Project:</h2>
    <p>
      *Year 2020 will always be remembered because of a major pandemic which the world is still grappling with, that is Covid 19Studies have shown that the spread of COVID has been slower at locations where people are wearing mask.
In order to study the spread of the virus, determining if masks are properly being worn by people or not, or whether they are being worn at all plays a key role.
Our project is based on this line of thought : When presented with an image or a live video, the python based code will label each face in one of the three categories : With Mask, Without Mask, Improperly worn mask
